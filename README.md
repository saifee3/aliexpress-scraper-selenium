## Usage 🚀

### Basic Operation
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python scraper.py
   ```
2. Enter the product name when prompted. The scraper will:
   - Open AliExpress in a browser window
   - Search for the specified product
   - Wait for all products to load
   - Extract product names and prices
   - Save the data to `aliexpress_products.csv`

## Data Extraction Process 📝

### Inspecting the Website Structure
To effectively extract data from AliExpress or any website, it's crucial to understand the underlying HTML structure. Here's how to approach it:

1. **Open Developer Tools**: Right-click on the webpage and select "Inspect" or press `F12` to open Chrome Developer Tools.
2. **Locate Target Elements**: Find the elements containing the data you want to extract (product titles, prices, etc.).
3. **Identify Unique Selectors**: Look for unique class names, IDs, or other attributes that can be used to reliably select these elements.
4. **Consider Hierarchy**: Note the nesting of elements to create more precise selectors that reduce the chance of selecting unintended elements.

### Choosing Between XPaths and CSS Selectors
Both XPaths and CSS selectors have their strengths:
- **CSS Selectors**: Generally faster and more readable, especially for simpler selections. Ideal when targeting elements based on class names, IDs, or direct parent-child relationships.
- **XPaths**: More powerful for complex queries, especially when needing to navigate the DOM tree in more flexible ways or when text content needs to be matched.

### Best Practices for Robust Data Extraction
- **Avoid Fragile Selectors**: Don't rely on classes or IDs that might change frequently or are used inconsistently across the site.
- **Use Relative Paths**: When using XPaths, prefer relative paths over absolute paths to make your selectors more resilient to structure changes.
- **Test Selectors Thoroughly**: Validate your selectors against multiple pages and different search results to ensure consistency.
- **Handle Dynamic Content**: Be aware of elements that might load asynchronously and implement appropriate waiting mechanisms.
- **Document Your Selectors**: Keep a record of the selectors you're using and their purpose, which will be invaluable when maintaining or updating the scraper.
